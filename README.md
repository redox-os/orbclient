### Troubleshooting

* Make sure that you work with the current ```nightly``` version of Rust
  * To make sure of that, please use [rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs)
  * Don't forget to override your work directory with ```rustup override set nightly```
  * Don't forget to update the ```nightly``` version of Rust with ```rustup update nightly```
* SDL2 should be build within orbclient if you have trouble try to install it ```libsdl2-dev``` manually
